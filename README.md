# Unsupervised Learning w Crypto

This Python application highlights the fundamentals of unsupervised learning by analyzing performance of cryptocurrencies. It illustrates the importance of finding optimal k-values for KMeans, the power of the elbow-graph visualization and finally, optimizing clusters for principal component analysis (or PCA).

## Usage

1. Navigate to the directory in either the Terminal or GitBash. 

2. From the top folder (Challenge_10), launch jupyter lab by typing 'jupyter lab' into Terminal or Gitbash and pressing 'Enter'

3. Open the 'crypto_investments.ipynb' notebook and follow the instructions therein.

4. The application begins by loading in the data from the resources folder. This will allow you to perform the necessary analyses leveraging KMeans later on. This data will also be prepared by a number of functions.

5. Subsequently, the analysis begins with the original data that has been prepared by the functions in the application, followed by a comparative analysis with PCA data. This comparative analysis allows the use to better understand the value of PCA data and explained variances.

6. Lastly, the application illustrates the difference between the analyses using a side-by-side graphic, first with Elbow graphs, followed by scatter plots.
